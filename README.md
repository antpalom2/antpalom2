# 👋 Hi there! I'm Antonio!

## 🧠 About Me
I'm a bilingual (English & Spanish) professional with a background in philosophy, customer support, and data-driven storytelling. I’m passionate about turning raw information into clear, visual insights — from dashboards to executive reports.

Currently, I’m diving deep into data analytics and visualization using Tableau and Power BI, while building a portfolio that reflects both analytical precision and narrative clarity.
